Each spin costs the amount you bet.
The goal is to land a winning combination on the middle row.
Refer to the payout table for combinations and their respective multipliers.
The BAR symbol acts as a wildcard, substituting for any other symbol to complete a winning combination. 🍒│BAR│🍒 => 🍒🍒🍒
If a bell appears anywhere on the middle row, you earn one extra spin for free.
If you win on a spin, your bet is multiplied by the payout multiplier and added to your total balance.
If you do not win on a spin, you lose the amount you bet for that roll.
The game continues while you have money to bet or until you click the "End Game" button.
Money is deducted or added to your total balance only when the game ends.
Only the middle row of the reels is checked for winning combinations.
