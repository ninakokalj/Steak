Tries:

Each player starts with 10 tries to spin the reels.
The goal is to land a winning combination on the middle row.

Winning Combinations:

Refer to the payout table for combinations and their respective multipliers.
The BAR symbol acts as a wildcard, substituting for any other symbol to complete a winning combination.
Example: Two cherries and a BAR symbol will count as three cherries.

Bonus Round:

If a bell appears anywhere on the middle row, you earn one extra round.

Winning and Payouts:

If you win enough to exceed your initial betting amount at any point, you can no longer lose.
You will keep any amount above your starting bet, regardless of future spins.
If you hit the "Pull Out" button when your total is higher than your starting bet, you will keep your winnings and end the game.
If your total matches your starting bet and you hit "Pull Out," you will lose the amount you initially bet.

Losing:

If you use all 10 tries and do not win any money, your starting bet is lost.

Important:

Only the middle row of the reels is checked for winning combinations.
